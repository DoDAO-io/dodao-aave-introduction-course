- [ ]  New aTokens and debt tokens will not be minted for GHO
- [ ]  The Aave protocol will become slower due to integration of a new stablecoin
- [x]  Aave market on Ethereum would become the first facilitator
  
Hint: noHint

##### Which of these are true regarding GHO’s adoption?  

- [ ]  Using portals, GHO cannot be minted on Ethereum and be transferred to other chains easily
- [ ]  Penetration into L2 chains would be impossible
- [ ]  Penetration into L2 chains would be undesirable as they are loosing popularity amongst a vast majority of general users
- [x]  Penetration into L2 chains would be desirable as they are gaining popularity amongst a vast majority of general users
  
Hint: noHint
         
Explanation: Using portals, GHO can be minted on Ethereum and be transferred to other chains easily. The non-crypto native user base prefers stablecoins. Penetration into L2 chains would be desirable as they are gaining popularity amongst a vast majority of general users.
