##### What is Collateral?  

- [ ]  Collateral is net returns on lent assets.
- [ ]  Collateral refers to the net worth of the loan.
- [x]  Collateral is something pledged as security for repayment of a loan, to be forfeited in the event of a default.

##### Why is there the need for over-collateralization?  

- [ ]  Over-collateralization helps to find bugs in the smart-contracts.
- [ ]  Over-collateralization helps to increase the interest rates for lenders.
- [x]  Over-collateralization is needed to cover potential losses in case of default. The extra collateral helps to cover the loan in case the loan value exceeds the value of collateral.
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Over-collateralization is when you put up more collateral than what is needed to cover a loan. This extra collateral can help to cover potential losses in case of default. Having over-collateralization can help to reduce the risk of default and ensures the security of assets.

##### What are the use cases of lending and borrowing?  

- [x]  Lending increases the value of assets by gaining interest.
- [ ]  Lending improves decentralization and security.
- [x]  Borrowing helps you to get money in urgent situations or for improvement purposes when capital is insufficient.
- [x]  Borrowing increases an investment's potential return through leveraging.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Lending increases the value of assets by gaining interest on the lent assets and borrowing helps you to get money in urgent situations or for improvement purposes when capital is insufficient. Borrowing increases an investment's potential return through leveraging.

##### How DeFi's are obtaining realtime data like asset prices, since blockchains are isolated and cannot talk to the web?  

- [ ]  Blockchains get real world data from internet
- [x]  Through oracles
- [ ]  They can't get real world data
- [ ]  None of the above
  
Hint: Oracle
         
Explanation: Oracles are nodes which provides realtime data like asset prices to the blockchains.

##### Which of the following are correct about traditional Finance?  

- [x]  Traditional Finances are centralized and allows censorship.
- [x]  Traditional Finances takes most of the interest from borrowers.
- [ ]  Traditional Finances will provide loans without any agreements and paperworks.
- [x]  Traditional Finances are simple and less riskier as its regulated.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: TradFi is centralized and simpler for the user end when compared to DeFi. Traditional Finances takes most of the interest from borrowers.

##### What are some privacy issues in TradFi?  

- [ ]  Banks check and collect the data from all the legal documents of an user for opening account.
- [x]  Users are required to complete their KYC.
- [x]  Transactions are monitored in TradFi.
- [ ]  No personal data is required for lending and borrowing in TradFi.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Users are required to complete their KYC and transactions are monitored in TradFi.

##### In decentralized finance (DeFi), when users lend their assets, who maintains possession of them?  

- [ ]  Assets are controlled by Swiss bank.
- [x]  Assets are maintained by smart-contracts of the protocol.
- [ ]  Assets are secured by group of Finance companies.
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Users assets are maintained by smart-contracts of the protocol.

##### Which of the following is(are) correct about DeFi protocols?  

- [x]  Users can lend and borrow assets anonymously within DeFi protocols.
- [x]  Interest rates vary for different assets in DeFi protocols.
- [ ]  Majority of the interest that accrues goes to DeFi protocols.
- [x]  Fees in DeFi are quite less as compared to TradFi and majority of the interest that accrues goes to lenders.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Users can lend and borrow assets without revealing their identities within DeFi protocols. The rates of return differ for different assets in DeFi protocols. The majority of the interest that accrues goes to lenders.

##### How are DeFi protocols governed?  

- [x]  Most of the DeFi protocols are governed by native token holders of the protocol.
- [ ]  DeFi protocols are governed by lenders.
- [ ]  DeFi protocols are governed by group of banks.
- [ ]  None of These.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Most of the DeFi protocols are governed by native token holders of the protocol. Token holders vote on different proposals to update or enhance the protocol.

##### What are the advantages of DeFi protocol's?  

- [x]  DeFi's are resistant to censorship.
- [ ]  DeFi's are simple and no risks involved in it.
- [x]  DeFi's are transparent hence no hidden fees are involved in DeFi.
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: DeFi's are resistant to censorship and transparent. No hidden fees are involved in DeFi's. Most of the interest from the borrowers goes to lenders.

##### How DeFi protocols are efficient?  

- [x]  DeFi's automate the protocol using smart-contracts.
- [x]  The possibility of server down is very low in DeFi's.
- [x]  DeFi's are transparent their core smart-contracts can be viewed and analzed by anyone.
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: Decentralized and smart-contracts.
         
Explanation: DeFi's automate the protocol using smart-contracts. Since DeFi's are running on blockchain the possibility of server down is very low. They are transparent their core smart-contracts can be viewed and analyzed by anyone.

##### What are Flashloans?  

- [ ]  It is an ordinary loan which can be borrowed in TradFi with low interest rates.
- [ ]  It is a zero interest loan which can be borrowed by locking collateral with twice the value of borrowed amount.
- [x]  Flashloans are loans which can be borrowed instantly without any collateral by using smart-contracts with certain conditions.
- [ ]  It is an alternate name of an ordinary loan in DeFi's.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Flashloans are loans which can be borrowed instantly without any collateral by using smart-contracts with certain conditions.

- [x]  Loan-to-value(LTV)
- [ ]  Market cap
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: DeFi protocols mitigates this issue by considering several factors. The two important factors are Loan-to-value and Healthfactor.

##### What is collateral liquidation?  

- [ ]  It is the process of gaining interest for locked collateral by borrowers.
