##### What is Collateral?  

- [ ]  Collateral is net returns on lent assets
- [ ]  Collateral refers to the net worth of the loan
- [x]  Collateral is something pledged as security for repayment of a loan, to be forfeited in the event of a default
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: Collateral
         
Explanation: Collateral is an asset pledged as security for repayment of a loan. If the borrower defaults, the lender can seize the collateral. Borrowers need to pledge collateral to lenders in order to get a loan.

##### Why is there the need for over-collateralization?  

- [ ]  Over-collateralization helps to find bugs in the smart-contracts
- [ ]  Over-collateralization helps to increase the interest rates for lenders
- [x]  Over-collateralization is needed to cover potential losses in case of default. The extra collateral helps to offset the volatility of asset, providing extra security
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: Volatility
         
Explanation: When you over-collateralize, you're putting up more collateral than what's necessary to cover a loan. This extra collateral can help to cover potential losses in case of default, and to offset the volatility of the asset.

##### What are the use cases of lending and borrowing?  

- [x]  Through the acquisition of interest, lending raises the value of assets
- [ ]  Lending improves decentralization and security
- [x]  Borrowing helps you to get money in urgent situations or for improvement purposes when capital is insufficient
- [ ]  Borrowing increases the borrowers capital
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Lending increases the value of assets by gaining interest on the lent assets and borrowing helps you to get money in urgent situations or for improvement purposes when capital is insufficient.

##### How DeFi protocols obtain realtime data like asset prices, since blockchains are isolated and cannot talk to the web?  

- [ ]  Blockchains get real world data from internet
- [x]  Through oracles
- [ ]  They can't get real world data
- [ ]  Real-world data for blockchains is obtained directly from users
  
Hint: Oracle
         
Explanation: Oracles are nodes which provides realtime data like asset prices to the blockchains.

##### What is the benefit of eliminating middlemen in DeFi protocols?  

- [ ]  In order to lend assets, lenders need to use smart-contracts
- [ ]  Under-collateralized loans can be borrowed
- [x]  Majority of the accrued interest goes to the lenders
- [ ]  Loans are provided at zero interest rate
  
Hint: Lending
         
Explanation: The elimination of middlemen in DeFi protocols makes them more efficient and allows lenders to keep more of the interest that is accrued.

##### In decentralized finance (DeFi), when users lend their assets, who maintains possession of them?  

- [ ]  Assets are maintained by the founders and developers of the protocol
- [x]  Assets are maintained by smart-contracts of the protocol
- [ ]  Assets are maintained by group of Finance companies
- [ ]  Assets are maintained by an AI
  
Hint: Smart-contracts

##### Which of the following is (are) correct about lending and borrowing in DeFi protocols?  

- [x]  Users can lend and borrow assets anonymously within DeFi protocols
- [ ]  If users own the native token of the protocol, they can borrow assets with zero interest
- [ ]  The majority of interest that accrues goes to DeFi protocols
- [x]  The fees in DeFi are significantly lower than in TradFi, so most of the interest that accrues goes to lenders
  
Hint: Privacy
         
Explanation: Users can lend and borrow assets without revealing their identities within DeFi protocols. The majority of the interest that accrues goes to lenders.

##### How are DeFi protocols governed?  

- [x]  Most of the DeFi protocols are governed by native token holders of the protocol who vote on proposals to update or enhance the protocol
- [ ]  DeFi protocols are governed by lenders
- [ ]  DeFi protocols are governed by group of banks
- [ ]  DeFi protocols are governed by a diverse group of selected people from around the world
  
Hint: Native token holders
         
Explanation: Most of the DeFi protocols are governed by the native token holders of the protocol. Token holders vote on different proposals to update or enhance the protocol - something that isn't possible with traditional finance. Traditional finance is instead governed by higher authorities within the institutions.

##### What are the benefits of using DeFi protocols for lending and borrowing?  

- [x]  DeFi's are resistant to censorship, hence anyone can participate in lending and borrowing on these platforms
- [x]  DeFi protocols are automated using smart contracts
- [x]  DeFi's are transparent hence no hidden fees are involved in DeFi protocols
- [x]  DeFi eliminates the need for middlemen, which can increase the profitability of lenders
  
Hint: Decentralized and transparent
         
Explanation: Decentralized finance protocols are unique in that they're resistant to censorship and more transparent than traditional financial institutions. With DeFi, there are no hidden fees involved because the protocols are automated using smart contracts. This also eliminates the need for middlemen, which can in turn increase the profitability of lenders.

##### In what basis personal loans are offered in traditional finance?  

- [x]  Credit score
- [ ]  Loan-to-value
- [x]  Income level
- [ ]  Healthfactor
  
Hint: Credit score
         
Explanation: Traditional financial institutions offer loans based on an individual's credit score, income level, and repayment capacity. The primary condition for personal loans from these lenders is to maintain a high credit score.

##### What are Flashloans?  

- [ ]  A loan from TradFi usually has low interest rates
- [ ]  It is a zero interest loan that can be borrowed by using collateral that is worth twice the amount of the loan
- [x]  Flashloans are loans that can be borrowed and repaid instantaneously, without the need for collateral, by using smart contracts with certain conditions
- [ ]  Flashloans are an alternate name of an ordinary loan in DeFi's
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Flashloans are a unique type of loan that can be borrowed and repaid instantaneously, without the need for collateral, by using smart contracts. This type of loan is not available in traditional finance, which makes it a great option for those who need quick access to funding.

##### What is Collateral liquidation?  

- [ ]  Collateral liquidation is the act of using gold as security to borrow money
- [ ]  It is the process of distributing profits among the native token holders
- [x]  It is the forced sale of pledged collateral by the borrower to repay a loan
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: Volatility
         
Explanation: Collateral liquidation is when the borrower is forced to sell their pledged collateral to repay a loan. This may happen because of the volatility of assets.

##### When collateral liquidation occurs?  

- [ ]  It occurs when Healthfactor equals to zero
- [x]  It occurs when Healthfactor approaches to one
- [ ]  It occurs when a lender withraws the lent assets
- [ ]  It occurs at the time of borrowing loans
  
Hint: Healthfactor
         
Explanation: Collateral liquidation happens when your Healthfactor gets close to one. Borrowers need to keep their Healthfactor above 1 to avoid being liquidated.
