          "details": "#### What is DeFi?\nDecentralized finance, or \"DeFi\" for short, is the concept of a financial institution built on blockchain technology that is not controlled by a single entity. Instead, it is governed by a set of rules that can be modified by users. This allows for a more democratic approach to \nbanking, as there is no central point of power. A DeFi platform is different from traditional financial institutions because it doesn't have people working behind the scenes to run things - instead, it relies on code-based logic. These blocks of code are called smart contracts, \nand they're deployed on the blockchain. One key feature of smart contracts is that the data they write on the chain is immutable, which means it can't be changed once the transactions are settled. \nTo the DeFi protocol, every blockchain address is an entity. As long as the entity satisfies the conditions that the smart contract programmer puts forth, it's allowed to perform the desired action.\n"

          "shortTitle": "Why DeFi",
          "key": "why-do-we-need-defi",
          "details": "#### Why do we need DeFi?\nBanks have been around for a very long time, but the rate of innovation in the banking sector is quite slow. In the past decade, \nmany things have changed, including:\n\n1) Our economy is now a global economy, instead of being limited to just one country.\n2) People prefer online transactions that are instant, instead of in-person banking. \n3) Need for more flexibility in how funds can be collected and distributed.\n\nDeFi (decentralized finance) aims to provide an alternative to traditional banking that comes up with solutions for existing flaws in the banking system. DeFi is based on blockchain technology and offers the following solutions to problems faced in TradFi.\n\n#### Innovation:\nThe traditional finance sector has not seen many innovations in the past decade, this has made way for a scenario where newer problems keep arising owing to the developments in technology with \nno proper solutions. The users do not have a say in the working of TradFi and the only very people hold authority to be able to innovate in the banking sector which leads to very slow innovation.\nDeFi is open to all, this creates way for developers to come up with solutions to existing problems and build Decentralized apps which are interconnected, which cater to the DeFi ecosystem. Moreover,\nthe governance of DeFi is such that it paves for innovation.\n\n#### Accessibility:\nBanks work on a credit-based system, which means that they need to be confident that you will repay your loan in full. To get a loan from a bank, you will need to have a good credit score and/or provide collateral in case you default on the loan. \nThis puts people who are on the margins or are just getting started at a disadvantage because they are left out of the current financial system. This leaves many people around the globe\nunbanked, since they lack the financial knowledge and capital that banks demand. DeFi on the other hand is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, all you need is a valid blockchain \naddress. No centralized entity can block or deny you access to anything.\n\n#### Interest Rates:\nBanks profit by charging a higher interest rate to borrowers than they offer to lenders. This can lead to a situation where the rich lend to the rich, which promotes circulation of assets within one part of society and can worsen economic conditions.\nDeFi decides the interest rates based off of maths of the supply-demand for lending and borrowing of a certain asset and thus is less likely to be overvalued or undervalued.\n\n#### Transparency and inefficiency:\nBanks run background checks on the borrower and have loads of legal paperwork and agreements that need to be signed. Their process of sanctioning a loan is a lengthy and time-consuming one. Add to that the possibility of human lethargy. \nBanks are notoriously known for being inefficient. In DeFi, Services that were previously slow and at risk of human error are automatic and safer now that they're handled by code that anyone can inspect and scrutinize.\n\n#### Flexibility:\nThe markets are no longer just local. We live in the era of the internet, markets are global. Banks still operate at a local level and find it harder and harder to cater to the global market with their existing mechanisms. \nMovement of assets is not even possible, if it is, it is a hassle. Exchange and movement of assets is seamless in DeFi.\n\n#### Governance:\nIn DeFi protocols, the users are often given voting power to elect the changes that should be made to the protocol. Each protocol has a different governance structure but the concept of voting on changes is a constant and has allowed for a more transparent \nand accessible finance option than TradFi has ever been able to achieve.\n"

          "key": "how-does-defi-work",
          "details": "Before we get to understand how DeFi works, we need to know how a blockchain works. It is essential since DeFis runs on the blockchain and has many features in common \nwith or affiliated to the blockchain that might not make much sense in a non-blockchain context.\n\n\n#### Blockchain Basics:\nA blockchain is a digital ledger of data, a chain of blocks, hence the name - blockchain. You can imagine it to be a series of record books that are connected to each other. \nEach of these records have three important pieces of information: \n\n1. The data stored in the block\n2. A hash (An encoded string of characters) uniquely generated with respect to the data it contains  \n3. The hash of the previous blockchain. \n\nSince the hash of a block depends on its data, it changes if the data in the block is tampered with. Since the hashing information on the next blockchain about the changed blockchain will be wrong if the hash is changed, the rest of the blockchain is invalidated on tampering with one block. \nThis way it is hard to tamper with the data in a blockchain since it would mean all the blocks coming after should also be changed.\nVarious technologies like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and our topic of discussion, DeFi protocols are all built on top of blockchains and this is why, the DeFi protocols are a safer, \nmore transparent and a secure way of finance. Now that we have seen what a blockchain is, let us look at some of the use cases of DeFi.\n"

          "title": "Use cases of DeFi",
          "shortTitle": "Defi use cases",
          "key": "use-cases-of-defi",
          "details": "#### Lending and Borrowing:\nThe main issue with borrowing money from banks is that it's a very pricey endeavor. Banks make a profit from the difference in APR between what the depositor is paid and what the borrower is charged. Obviously, it's in the bank's best interest to increase the premiums the borrower pays to maximize its profits. And that's exactly what happens. \nBanks charge enormous premiums on the money borrowed, and the return on investment they provide to the depositor is shockingly low, as little as 0.05% APY. \nDeFi mitigates the problem of unnecessarily high interest rates by employing logic that determines APY and interest premiums based on the supply-demand of a given asset.\nLending in DeFi is often a more profitable endeavor than TradFi because the returns available in DeFi protocols are often much higher than the measly 0.05% offered in traditional finance. Furthermore, it is a much safer option; in the event of a default on loan repayment or a \ndecrease in the value of the security deposit, the protocol will automatically liquidate the collateral and give the proceeds to the lender. While this may sound like a simple process, there is actually quite complex logic involved in determining whether or not a loan is undercollateralized. Lending and borrowing in DeFi is again a vast topic, with various concepts that are largely different from those found in traditional finance. For example, a loan can be taken with a\nfixed interest rate or a variable one and the collateral itself can be swapped for a different asset, to name a few. But that is a topic for another day. \n\n\n#### Exchanging of Assets(Exchanges):\nIn central exchanges (Traditional exchanges), often, the central body takes control of the user's private keys (i.e., custody of the user's funds). They validate their users using KYCs (Know Your User) and valid document proof of the user. \nThey also have strict norms regarding the currencies that can be listed on their exchange. Decentralized exchanges, on the other hand, are trustless and permissionless. That is, the user stays anonymous. No central body exists for the user's \nauthorization or the listing of currencies. The user has complete control of their wallet for the whole duration, unlike most central exchanges, where they act as custodians for the user's private keys.\nThere are different types of DEX, notably AMM (Automated market maker), DEX aggregators (liquidity aggregators), and Order Book DEX.\nIn short, \n\n* AMMs work on the concept of liquidity pools, where people provide liquidity for given currency pairs (equal values of both currencies) and get incentivized. Users can make use of these pools to exchange currencies. \n* DEX Aggregators allow users to get the best exchange rates by simultaneously interacting with multiple liquidity pools. It is worth noting that all types of exchanges usually suffer from a lack of liquidity, especially for large-scale transactions. \n  DEX aggregators help solve the problem partially by allowing the user to exchange from a larger scale of pools.\n* Order Book DEX is like a marketplace where some buyers and sellers ask their price and, consequently, determine the market price for the currency under consideration. This process of listing can occur on-chain or off-chain. \n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both centralized and decentralized exchanges, but that is not the focus of this section. \n\n\n#### Flash loans:\nDeFi offers loans to the borrower, requiring no collateral to be handed over, these loans are called Flash loans. Flash loans require no collateral and no credibility. With flash loans, DeFi lends you seemingly any amount of money. \nBut this money must be used and repaid within one transaction block (around 10s). In case the money is not paid back, all changes made to the blockchain after the flash loan are reverted, and it is as if nothing happened at all. \nIt is to be noted that the user incurs gas fee for any transaction he does during this time.\n\n\n#### Tokenization: \nRealworld assets can be stored in the blockchain as tokens. For example, real estate tokenization. Real estate tokenization is the token form of a physical real estate which could represent partial ownership, complete ownership, a right to share in the profits generated by real property, \nor an interest in a debt secured by real property. A real estate token acts like an NFT, with no other identical copy on the blockchain. The token can accrue interest, and serve as proof of ownership, etc. This also enables fractional property ownership, like a company's stocks, \nwith all the owners able to reap property returns (for example, rent). Blockchain is global, ensuring that investors from across the world can invest or buy real estate in the USA - _seamlessly_.\nThe elimination of a third party also ensures that the transactional costs are kept at a minimum. Debt tokenization is another exciting application of this technology. On borrowing or investing, tokens are minted for the user. \nThese tokens accrue interests. On debt repayment or withdrawal of investment, the tokens are burnt. Similarly, tokenized securities (bonds, options, stocks, etc.) can be used to digitize securities, improving their safety and providing 24-hour trading windows, since blockchains are global.\nTokenization in the digital security spectrum is also implemented as a pointer that directs to sensitive information and data.\n\n  \n"

These are very helpful for creating Dapps.\n\n**ROI** - Return on investment is the total value of the investment, which includes the initial amount, profits, and losses.\n\n**Leverage** - In financial terms, leverage is an investment strategy for increasing the potential return of investment by borrowing loans. \n\n**EMI** - An equated monthly installment (EMI) is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. \nEquated monthly installments are applied to both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full. \n\n**Oracles** - These are the nodes that provide real-world data to the blockchain since blockchains are isolated environments.\n\n**Loan to value** - It is a ratio that tells how much of a loan can be borrowed against the collateral.\n\n**Over collateralization** - Collateral is locked with higher value than borrowed value in order to cover the potential losses of the collateral in case of any fault.\n\n## Intro to Lending and Borrowing \n\nLending is an action of allowing a person or an organization to use the sum of money under an agreement to pay it back later with remuneration, usually in the form of interest. \nBorrowing in finance involves borrowing money under an agreement to pay it back with interest. The person or organization that lends the money is called the lender. \n\nThe person or organization who borrows the money under an agreement to pay it back is called a borrower. Successful lending and borrowing occur when both the lender and borrower \nagree to the terms and conditions. The assets can be anything of value, such as money, land, or gold.\n\n### Use cases of Lending and Borrowing\n\nBy lending assets and charging interest on those assets, lenders are able to increase the value of their assets while also providing borrowers with an incentive to use their assets. \nThis helps to counteract the effects of inflation by increasing the value of assets over time.\n\nBorrowers take out loans to increase the capital for their businesses, startups, etc. Borrowers leverage their investments by investing in vehicles like the stock market, mutual funds, \nbonds, etc to amplify their returns. People make use of EMI to buy products. Borrowing helps to tackle financial emergencies and medical emergencies. People may borrow for education. \nIn a nutshell, borrowing helps you to get money in urgent situations or for improvement purposes when capital is insufficient.\n"

          "details": "### Lending and Borrowing in TradFi \n\nIn traditional finance, banks and other financial institutions play a significant role. They work based on trust - users or customers must trust these institutions to lend and borrow assets. \nLending and borrowing in traditional finance are centralized; these financial institutions will provide interest to lenders for lending money to them. Lending in traditional finance is simple \nand risks are low. Customers must complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to lend and borrow money. Financial institutions offer users loans to make a profit from the interest of the lent assets.\n\nThe banks take most of the interest or profits, leaving little potential return for lenders. Users can choose to invest in the stock market or other investment vehicles for higher returns; \nhowever, the ROI and security are not guaranteed. With banks, the interest is fixed for lenders, and therefore, the returns are guaranteed. In general, banks are pretty reliable when it\ncomes to safeguarding your money. They're required by law to meet specific standards and criteria, so you can rest assured knowing that your money is in good hands. That said, it's \nstill important to be mindful of your balance and keep enough money in your account to avoid being charged fees. \n\nTraditional finances usually allow users to borrow money when they meet certain conditions or criteria. These conditions may vary for different types of loans. But for most loans, users or \ncustomers need to put up collateral to get the loan. Loans from traditional financial institutions usually have higher interest rates for borrowers than lenders. For personal loans, users must \nhave a specific threshold value of credit score to borrow the money. The paperwork and multiple agreements required to borrow loans from banks make the process quite complex for users. \nDifferent types of users and loans have different borrowing limits set by banks, who analyze factors such as a user's past banking activities, income, credit score, and other conditions before approving a loan.\n\nIn a nutshell, the banks play the middlemen role between the lenders and borrowers but make high profits by providing different interest rates for lenders and borrowers. Users are required to trust them to lend their assets. \nThe governance is controlled by major shareholders or higher authorities of the bank.\n\n\n### Disadvantages of Lending and Borrowing in TradFi \n\n**Governance and privacy:** Traditional finances are centralized hence all the changes to the finance are made by specific people. The customer must complete their KYC for lending and borrowing. Transactions are monitored. \nTraditional finance has the right to censorship hence they can ban specific people if they want. Traditional finances are prone to mismanagement and fraud.\n\n**Complexity and user experience:** The customers must do paperwork like filling out different forms and signing agreements for lending(at the time of account opening) and borrowing, which makes the process quite complex. \nTransaction limits are imposed on users, which gives a bad user experience. The users are required to maintain a minimum balance to avoid charges. \n\n**Capital and system inefficiency:** The interest rates are less for lenders and high for borrowers. Traditional finance takes most of the profits from the borrowers. This makes the lenders' capital inefficient. \nThere is a chance of servers going down for traditional finances as they are centralized. Traditional finances are not transparent. They have numerous blind spots.\n"

          "details": "## Lending and Borrowing in DeFi \n\nLending and borrowing in DeFi are secured by blockchain and smart contracts. There is no requirement for KYC and paperwork for lending and borrowing. \nUsers can lend their money without limits similarly, withdrawal is also limitless. Lending and Borrowing in DeFi is anonymous hence privacy is maintained. \nLending and borrowing in DeFi are resistant to censorship. DeFi protocols are non-profit protocols hence most of the interest from the borrowers goes to lenders. This makes the protocol capital efficient. \nThe possibility of server down is very low as they run on the blockchain. Lending and borrowing in DeFi's are almost instant. Maintenance of minimum balance isn't necessary in the case of DeFi.\n\nDeFi protocols offer different interest rates for different assets. Users can borrow assets by using collateral as security. The amount of collateral must be \nmore than the amount borrowed, and it should follow the protocol's over-collateralization limit. Flash loans are loans that can be obtained instantly and without any collateral. \nFlash loans can be borrowed by using smart contracts and available for only specific protocols like Aave and Uniswap. \n\nMost DeFi protocols are governed by their native token holders. Hence every change to the protocol will be done by the token holders. DeFi's are built on smart contracts \nhence anyone can view and analyze the protocol.\n\n\n### Interacting with Smart Contracts\n\nBenefits of DeFi Lending and Borrowing\n\n1. **Efficiency**-  No manual steps, everything is automated using smart contracts. The possibility of server down is very low. \n2. **Universal**- DeFi's are resistant to censorship and anyone can participate in lending and borrowing from any part of the world.\n3. **No hidden fees**- Elimination of middlemen prevents hidden fees for lenders and borrowers. DeFi protocols are transparent,\nanyone can view and analyze their core smart contracts. Most of the interest from borrowers goes to lenders. \n"

          "key": "Managing-Risks",
          "details": "## Managing Risks\n\n### Volatility Risk \n\nLending and borrowing in DeFi protocols can be done using cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, so users must consider the volatility of the assets before lending or borrowing. \nHowever, users can lend and borrow stablecoins to neglect this risk.\n\n#### Collateral Liquidation\nCollateral liquidation is the forced sale of pledged collateral by the borrower to repay a loan. Collateral liquidation occurs when the sum of borrowed amount and interest exceeds its threshold value. \nThe values will differ for different DeFi's. The volatility of assets is also a factor that leads to collateral liquidation.\n\nDeFi tackles these issues by considering several factors. The important two factors are\n1. Loan To Value\n2. Healthfactor\n\nAssets with high volatility have very low loan-to-value ratios, meaning that users can borrow much less against them as collateral. Healthfactor helps users to \nknow whether a position is at risk of being liquidated due to insufficient collateral. For example, Aave's DAI tokens have a loan-to-value ratio of 77%, but Chainlink \ntokens have a loan-to-value ratio of just 70%. Since Chain Link tokens are more volatile than DAI, they have much lower loan-to-value ratios. Similarly When the health factor \nof a position in Aave approaches one, the position is in danger of being liquidated.\n\n### Protocol Risk\nDeFi's are growing and developing hence various risks are associated with the DeFi protocol. The risks involved are smart-contract risks, oracle risks, scaling risks, and other risks.\n\n#### Smart contract risk\nThese are the risks involved with the smart contracts in the protocol. Hackers or exploiters might exploit the protocol using bugs, Flash Loan attacks, etc. \nThese risks are mitigated by rigorous code audits.\n\n#### Oracle risks\nThese are risks involved with oracles. Blockchain is a sioled environment to get information from the real world, they use oracles to provide real-world data \nlike price feed, total supply, etc. Problems in oracles will be a massive problem for DeFi protocols. Even slight price differences in the protocol from the real world \ncause considerable losses to the protocol.  DeFi mitigates this risk by decentralized oracle networks like chainlink. For example chainlink aggregates independent high\nquality nodes or data providers in order to ensure security and high quality data.\n"

These are very helpful for creating Dapps.\n\n#### Leverage \nIn financial terms, leverage is an investment strategy for increasing the potential return of investment by borrowing loans. \n\n#### Oracles \nThese are the nodes that provide real-world data to the blockchain since blockchains are isolated environments.\n\n#### Loan to value \nIt is a ratio that tells how much of a loan can be borrowed against the collateral.\n\n#### Over collateralization \nCollateral is locked with higher value than borrowed value in order to cover the potential losses of the collateral in case of any fault.\n\n### Lending and borrowing basics\n* Lending is an action of allowing a person or an organization to use the sum of money under an agreement to pay it back later with remuneration, usually in the form of interest. \n* Borrowing in finance involves borrowing money under an agreement to pay it back with interest. \n\n### Use cases of Lending and Borrowing \n\n* By lending assets and charging interest on those assets, lenders are able to increase the value of their assets while also providing borrowers with an incentive to use their assets. \n* Borrowing helps you to get money in urgent situations or for improvement purposes when capital is insufficient.\n"

Customers must complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to lend and borrow money. \n* The banks play the middlemen role between the lenders and borrowers but make high profits by providing different interest rates for lenders and borrowers. \n* Traditional finances usually allow users to borrow money when they meet certain conditions or criteria. These conditions may vary for different types of loans.\n\n### Disadvantages of Lending and Borrowing in TradFi \n\n**Governance and privacy:** Traditional finances are centralized hence all the changes to the finance are made by specific people. Traditional finance has the right to censorship.\n\n**Complexity and user experience:** The customers must do paperworks for lending and borrowing, which makes the process quite complex. Transaction limits are imposed on users, which gives a bad user experience. \n\n**Capital and system inefficiency:** Traditional finance takes most of the profits from the borrowers. Traditional finances are not transparent.\n"

The possibility of server down is very low. \n2. **Universal**- DeFi's are resistant to censorship and anyone can participate in lending and borrowing from any part of the world.\n3. **No hidden fees**- Elimination of middlemen prevents hidden fees for lenders and borrowers.

          "details": "### Volatility Risk \n  \nLending and borrowing in DeFi protocols can be done using cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, \nso users must consider the volatility of the assets before lending or borrowing. \n  \n#### Collateral Liquidation\nCollateral liquidation is the forced sale of pledged collateral by the borrower to repay a loan. It occurs when the sum of borrowed amount and interest exceeds its threshold value. \nThe volatility of assets is also a factor that leads to collateral liquidation.\n  \nDeFi tackles these issues by considering several factors. The important two factors are\n1. Loan To Value\n2. Healthfactor\n\nAssets with high volatility have very low loan-to-value ratios, meaning that users can borrow much less against them as collateral. Healthfactor helps users to know whether a position is \nat risk of being liquidated due to insufficient collateral. \n\n### Protocol Risk \nDeFi's are growing and developing hence various risks are associated with the DeFi protocol. The risks involved are smart-contract risks, oracle risks, scaling risks, and other risks.\n  \n#### Smart contract risk\nThese are the risks involved with the smart contracts in the protocol. These risks are mitigated by rigorous code audits.\n  \n#### Oracle risks\nThese are risks involved with oracles. Blockchain is a sioled environment to get information from the real world, they use oracles to provide real-world data like price feed, total supply, etc. \nProblems in oracles will be a massive problem for DeFi protocols. DeFi mitigates this risk by decentralized oracle networks like chainlink.\n       \n       \n"
