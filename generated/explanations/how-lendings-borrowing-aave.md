 ## How to Lend and Borrow in AAVE
 
 **How to connect wallet to Aave**        
Aave is a decentralized finance platform that allows users to lend and borrow assets. In order to do so, users need to have a cryptocurrency wallet set up. 
Once the wallet is set up, they can then commence lending and borrowing on the Aave platform. Follow this link for Aave's Dapp: [Aave app](https://app.aave.com/).

We need to connect the wallet for lending and borrowing. So we need to click the "connect wallet" button and select your preferred wallet for lending and borrowing.

After connecting the wallet, the dashboard will look like this. We can select our preferred network for lending and borrowing assets; however, in order to do so, 
we need to pay gas fees similar to transactions. Consequently, we need to have some native token of the network to lend and borrow assets. For example, 
if we want to lend in Ethereum market, we need to own some ether for paying gas fees.

 **How to lend in Aave**        
In this tutorial, we will be demonstrating how to lend assets using the Test Network. For this guide, we will be using the MetaMask Wallet. 
If you have assets in your Wallet, you will have the option to supply those assets.

We will lend some USDC token - just click on the "supply" button. A new window will pop up; fill in the details and click on "supply USDC".

Now the connected wallet will pop up and asks for confirmation for the transaction. We need to confirm the transaction. Wait until the transaction complete.

After completing the procedure outlined above, your dashboard should look something like this. The interest rate is accrued based on the APY (annual percentage yield).
USDC can be used as collateral, as indicated by the tick mark in that column.

We have successfully lent USDC in Aave. We can add aTokens to our wallet for tracking the balances. This procedure is the same for all networks like Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, etc.
 
 **How to borrow in Aave**        
In this guide, we'll show you how to borrow assets from Aave. We'll use USDC as collateral to borrow DAI tokens.
To borrow DAI tokens, we need to connect our wallet to Aave, in the same way that we would if we were lending. The dashboard should look something like this:
For borrowing DAI, click "Borrow." Before borrowing, I had 0 DAI tokens in my Metamask wallet.

![AAVE](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-aave-introduction-course/blob/main/images/beforeborrowing.jpg?raw=true)

Enter the amount of DAI you would like to borrow, up to the maximum limit. Keep an eye on the health factor to make sure it stays at a good level. 
We're going to borrow at a stable rate, so click on the stable rate and hit “Borrow DAI.” The connected wallet will pop up for confirmation; hit confirm and wait 
until the transaction completes. That maximum value is determined by our locked collateral. In our case it is USDC which is used as collateral.

After completing the transaction, the dashboard will look something like this. We can add the tokens to our wallet after the transaction is completed.

![AAVE](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-aave-introduction-course/blob/main/images/BorrowedDAI.jpg?raw=true)

We have successfully borrowed DAI at a stable rate. Similarly, we can borrow at a variable rate. We have used USDC as collateral to borrow DAI. 
After borrowing the balance of DAI tokens is 1000 DAI in my wallet.
