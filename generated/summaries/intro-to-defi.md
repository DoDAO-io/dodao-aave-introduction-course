 ## What is DeFi and Use Cases
 
 **What is DeFi and why do we need it?**        
#### What is DeFi:
* Financial institution built on blockchain technology that is not controlled by a single entity. 
* It is governed by a set of rules that can be modified by users
* These rules are written in blocks of code called smart contracts which are deployed and run on the blockchain.  
* One key feature of smart contracts is that the data they write on the chain is immutable.
* To the DeFi protocol, every blockchain address is an entity. As long as the entity satisfies the conditions that the smart contract programmer puts forth, it's allowed to perform the desired action.

#### Why we need DeFi:
* Banks have a very slow rate of innovation and are unable to cope with modern day demands.
* Since the advent of internet, many things have changed:
  1) Our economy is now a global economy, instead of being limited to just one country;
  2) People prefer online transactions that are instant, instead of in-person banking; and
  3) Need for more flexibility in how funds can be collected and distributed.

* DeFi aims to provide an alternative to traditional banking and provide solutions for existing flaws in the banking system. 
* Some of the flaws in the banking sector are:

  - #### Innovation:
  * Traditional finance sector is very slow in terms of innovations in the past decade.
  * The authority to bring changes to the system lies in the hands of few people, making the rate of innovation even slower.
  * DeFi is open to all and promotes collaboration among developers to come up with solutions to existing problems.
  * Developer communities develop decentralized applications which help expanding the DeFi ecosystem and in making it more accessible.
 
  - #### Accessibility:
  * Banks operate on a credit based and put forth many qualifying criteria that make the banking sector less accessible to general public.
  * Many around the globe are unbanked or underbanked because of the financial knowledge and the high capital needed to invest in banks.
  * DeFi on the other hand is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, all you need is a valid blockchain address. No centralized entity can block or deny you access to payments.

  - #### High Interest Rates:
  * The banks provide the investors with very low returns and put forth very high interest rates for the borrowers. This creates a unfavourable scenario
    for all users involved.
  * DeFi decides the interest rates based off of maths of the supply-demand for lending and borrowing of a certain asset and thus is less likely to be overvalued or undervalued.

  - #### Transparency and Inefficiency:
  * Banks are centrally governed institutions whose working is not available to be scrutinized by the general public.
  * This means that the user does not know how his assets are being utilised. 
  * Banks have lengthy processes and paperworks concerning sanctioning of loans. They largely employ a human workforce which 
    creates the possibility of lethargy and human Inefficiency, further slowing the process.
  * In DeFi, Services that were previously slow and at risk of human error are automatic and safer now that they're handled by code that anyone can inspect and scrutinize.

  - #### Flexibility:
  * Banks operate at local levels and find it harder to cope with the global market.
    Movement of assets and conversions are a hassle. They provide very minimal flexibility in terms
    of asset movement or exchange.

  - #### Governance:
  * In DeFi protocols, the users are often given voting power to elect the changes that should be made to the protocol. Each protocol 
    has a different governance structure but the concept of voting on changes is a constant and has allowed for a more transparent and accessible finance option than TradFi.

  - #### Missed growth opportunities and unequal opportunities:
  * Potential high ROI projects not being executed due to high cost of credit from banks.
  * Projects should be financed based on the quality of the idea and the capability of the team behind the idea, but banks fail to achieve this owing to the fundamental design flaw (Credit-based system).
  * DeFi aims to eradicate this issue by being creditless and instantaneous. 
 
 **How DeFi works and its use cases**        
* DeFi protocols are run on the blockchain, so it is important to understand blockchain first.

#### Blockchain basics:
* A blockchain is a digital ledger of data, a chain of blocks, hence the name - blockchain.
* Each of the blocks have three important pieces of information: 
  1) The data stored in the block
  2) A hash (An encoded string of characters) uniquely generated with respect to the data it contains  
  3) The hash of the previous blockchain. 

* Since the hash of a block depends on its data, it changes if the data in the block is tampered with. 
* Since the hashing information on the next blockchain about the changed blockchain will be wrong, the blockchain is invalidated.
* DeFi protocols are all built on top of blockchains. This is why, the DeFi protocols are a safer, more transparent and a secure way of finance.

#### Use cases of DeFi:

- #### Lending and Borrowing:
* The main issue of lending and borrowing in TradFi is that it is expensive.
* It is in the bank's best interest to increase the premiums the borrower pays to maximize its profits. 
* DeFi mitigates the problem of unnecessarily high interest rates by employing logic that determines APY and interest premiums based on the supply-demand of a given asset.
* Lending in DeFi is often more profitable than in TradFi.
* In the event of a default on loan repayment or a decrease in the value of the security deposit, the protocol will automatically liquidate the collateral and give the proceeds to the lender.
* The process of borrowing in DeFi is seamless. The requirement is to have a valid blockchain address and hold an overcollaterized position for the given loan.
* Further, it is a much safer option as the lender always holds custody of his assets.

- #### Flash loans:
* DeFi offers loans to the borrower, requiring no collateral to be handed over, these loans are called Flash loans.
* The borrowed money must be used and repaid within one transaction block (around 10s).
* In case of a default in repayment, all changes made to the blockchain after the flashloan was taken are reverted and it is like nothing happened at all.
* The user only incurs gas fees in this whole process.

- #### Asset Exchanges:
* In central exchanges (Traditional exchanges), often, the central body takes custody of the user's funds.
* They validate their users using KYCs (Know Your User) and valid document proof of the user.
* They also have strict norms regarding the currencies that can be listed on their exchange. 
* Decentralized exchanges, on the other hand, are trustless and permissionless
* The user has complete custody of their assets throughout the process.

* There are different types of DEX, notably AMM (Automated market maker), DEX aggregators (liquidity aggregators), and Order Book DEX.

  1)AMMs work on the concept of liquidity pools, where people provide liquidity for given currency pairs (equal values of both currencies) and get incentivized. Users can make use of these pools to exchange currencies. 
  
  2)DEX Aggregators allow users to get the best exchange rates by simultaneously interacting with multiple liquidity pools. It is worth noting that all types of exchanges usually suffer from a lack of liquidity, especially for large-scale transactions. 
  DEX aggregators help solve the problem partially by allowing the user to exchange from a larger scale of pools.
  
  3)Order Book DEX is like a marketplace where some buyers and sellers ask their price and, consequently, determine the market price for the currency under consideration. This process of listing can occur on-chain or off-chain. 

- #### Tokenization:
* Realworld assets can be stored in the blockchain as tokens.
* For example, real estate tokenization. A real estate token acts like an NFT, with no other identical copy on the blockchain. The token can accrue interest, and serve as proof of ownership, etc.
* This also enables fractional property ownership, like a company's stocks, with all the owners able to reap property returns (for example, rent).
* Blockchain is global, ensuring that investors from across the world can invest or buy real estate in the USA.
* Another example is debt tokenization. On borrowing or investing, tokens are minted for the user. These tokens accrue interests. On debt repayment or withdrawal of investment, the tokens are burnt. 
* Tokenized securities (bonds, options, stocks, etc.) can be used to digitize securities, improving their safety and providing 24-hour trading windows, since blockchains are global.
