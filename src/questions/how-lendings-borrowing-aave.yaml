    Consider a case, Jack is a lender who wants to lend 1000 USDC in return for interest. He chooses Aave as his lending platform and deposits 1000 USDC. 
    In return, he gets 1000 aUSDC and adds the atokens to his wallet. Luna was Jack's friend, and she asked him for 200 USDC. However, Jack had already lent out all his USDC, 
    so he sent her 200 aUSDC instead. Luna kept the aUSDC as is, and after a few days, she connected her wallet to Aave.

    Which of the following option(s) is/are correct for the above case?
  hint: noHint
  explanation: |
   ATokens are transferable tokens that earn interest. Even though Jack owned ATokens through his wallet, any wallet can accrue interest from them. 
   Therefore, 200 aUSDC will earn interest for Luna even though she didn't connect her wallet to Aave. the ATokens of Luna can be used as a collateral if it is indicated.
