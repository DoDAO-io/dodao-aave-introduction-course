title: Introduction to AAVE (Completed)
key: aave-introductory-course
summary: >+
  Lending and borrowing refer to the act of lending money to another individual
  or entity, with the expectation that the borrowed funds will be repaid with
  interest at a later date. In the context of Aave, a decentralized finance
  platform, lending and borrowing refer to the ability for individuals to lend
  and borrow cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH), using smart contracts on the
  Ethereum blockchain. This allows users to earn interest on their holdings or
  access additional funds without the need for a traditional financial
  institution.

  In the Aave protocol, lending and borrowing is facilitated through the use of
  smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts act as
  digital agreements that automatically enforce the terms of a loan, such as the
  loan amount, interest rate, and repayment schedule.


  To borrow funds on Aave, a user must first deposit a certain amount of a
  supported cryptocurrency (such as Ether) as collateral. The user can then
  borrow a different cryptocurrency from the Aave protocol, with the deposited
  collateral serving as security for the loan. The user will be required to pay
  interest on the borrowed funds, and the loan must be repaid according to the
  agreed-upon terms.


  To lend on Aave, a user must first deposit a certain amount of a supported
  cryptocurrency into the Aave protocol. The user can then earn interest on
  their deposit by providing funds to borrowers on the platform. The interest
  earned will depend on the supply and demand for the chosen cryptocurrency and
  the terms of the loan.


  Overall, the Aave protocol allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in
  a decentralized and secure manner, without the need for a traditional
  financial institution.
