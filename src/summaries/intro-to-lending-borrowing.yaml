    - Important terms

      Credit score - It is the score determined by banking activities like repayment of loans, length of credit history, etc.

      Collateral - It is an asset that is locked to borrow loans.

      Smart contracts - These are pieces of code deployed in blockchains like Ethereum. These are very helpful for creating Dapps.

      Leverage - In financial terms, leverage is an investment strategy for increasing the potential return of investment by borrowing loans. 

      Oracles - These are the nodes that provide real-world data to the blockchain since blockchains are isolated environments.

      Loan to value - It is a ratio that tells how much of a loan can be borrowed against the collateral.

      Over collateralization - Collateral is locked with higher value than borrowed value in order to cover the potential losses of the collateral in case of any fault.

    - Lending and borrowing basics
      * Lending is an action of allowing a person or an organization to use the sum of money under an agreement to pay it back later with remuneration, usually in the form of interest. 
      * Borrowing in finance involves borrowing money under an agreement to pay it back with interest. 

    - Use cases of Lending and Borrowing 

      * By lending assets and charging interest on those assets, lenders are able to increase the value of their assets while also providing borrowers with an incentive to use their assets. 
      * Borrowing helps you to get money in urgent situations or for improvement purposes when capital is insufficient.

    - Lending and Borrowing in TradFi 

      * Traditional Finance work based on trust, users or customers must trust these institutions to lend and borrow assets. 
      * Lending in traditional finance is simple, and risks are low. Customers must complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to lend and borrow money. 
      * The banks play the middlemen role between the lenders and borrowers but make high profits by providing different interest rates for lenders and borrowers. 
      * Traditional finances usually allow users to borrow money when they meet certain conditions or criteria. These conditions may vary for different types of loans.

    - Disadvantages of Lending and Borrowing in TradFi 

      **Governance and privacy:** Traditional finances are centralized hence all the changes to the finance are made by specific people. Traditional finance has the right to censorship.

      **Complexity and user experience:** The customers must do paperworks for lending and borrowing, which makes the process quite complex. Transaction limits are imposed on users, which gives a bad user experience. 

      **Capital and system inefficiency:** Traditional finance takes most of the profits from the borrowers. Traditional finances are not transparent.

    - Lending and Borrowing in DeFi 
      * Lending and borrowing in DeFi are secured by blockchain and smart contracts. There is no requirement for KYC and paperwork for lending and borrowing. 
      * Users can lend their money without limits and  lending and borrowing in DeFi is anonymous. 
      * Lending and borrowing in DeFi are resistant to censorship. DeFi protocols are non-profit protocols hence most of the interest from the borrowers goes to lenders. 

    - Benefits of DeFi Lending and Borrowing
      1. **Efficiency**-  No manual steps, everything is automated using smart contracts. The possibility of server down is very low. 
      2. **Universal**- DeFi's are resistant to censorship and anyone can participate in lending and borrowing from any part of the world.
      3. **No hidden fees**- Elimination of middlemen prevents hidden fees for lenders and borrowers. DeFi protocols are transparent ,anyone can view and analyze their core smart contracts.

    - Volatility Risk 
      
      Lending and borrowing in DeFi protocols can be done using cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, 
      so users must consider the volatility of the assets before lending or borrowing. 
      
      * Collateral Liquidation
        Collateral liquidation is the forced sale of pledged collateral by the borrower to repay a loan. It occurs when the sum of borrowed amount and interest exceeds its threshold value. 
        The volatility of assets is also a factor that leads to collateral liquidation.
      
      DeFi tackles these issues by considering several factors. The important two factors are
      1. Loan To Value
      2. Healthfactor
      Assets with high volatility have very low loan-to-value ratios, meaning that users can borrow much less against them as collateral. Healthfactor helps users to know whether a position is 
      at risk of being liquidated due to insufficient collateral. 
    
    - Protocol Risk 
      DeFi's are growing and developing hence various risks are associated with the DeFi protocol. The risks involved are smart-contract risks, oracle risks, scaling risks, and other risks.
      
      * Smart contract risk
        These are the risks involved with the smart contracts in the protocol. These risks are mitigated by rigorous code audits.
      
      * Oracle risks
        These are risks involved with oracles. Blockchain is a sioled environment to get information from the real world, they use oracles to provide real-world data like price feed, total supply, etc. 
        Problems in oracles will be a massive problem for DeFi protocols. DeFi mitigates this risk by decentralized oracle networks like chainlink.
