   ### What is DeFi:
    * Financial institution built on blockchain technology, governed by a set of rules that can be modified by users that is not controlled by a single entity. 
    * These rules are written in blocks of code called smart contracts which are deployed and run on the blockchain.  
    * To the DeFi protocol, every blockchain address is an entity, an entity can perform an action given that it satisfies conditions put forth by the protocol.
   
   ### Why we need DeFi
   
   #### Innovation
     * Traditional finance sector is very slow in terms of innovations since the authority to bring change is with few people.
     * DeFi is open to all and promotes collaboration among developers to come up with solutions to existing problems and hence is faster to innovate.
    
   #### Accessibility
     * Banks put forth many qualifying criteria that make the banking sector less accessible to general public.
     * Many around the globe are underbanked because of the lack of financial knowledge and capital needed to invest in banks.
     * DeFi on the other hand is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, no centralized entity can block or deny you access to payments.

   #### High Interest Rates
     * The banks provide the investors with very low returns and put forth very high interest rates for the borrowers. 
     * DeFi decides the interest rates based off of maths of the supply-demand for lending and borrowing of a certain asset and thus is less likely to be overvalued or undervalued.

   #### Transparency and Inefficiency
     * The system on which banks work is not available to the general public, it is not possible to know how user's assets are utilized by the bank.
     * Banks have lengthy processes and paperworks concerning sanctioning of loans and they employ a human workforce which furthers the possibility of inefficiency.
     * In DeFi, Services are performed by code that anyone can review and scrutinize, thus being fast and less error prone.

   #### Flexibility:
     * Banks operate at local levels and find it harder to cope with the global market.
       Movement of assets and conversions are a hassle. They provide very minimal flexibility in terms
       of asset movement or exchange.

   #### Governance
     * In DeFi protocols, the users are often given voting power to elect the changes that should be made to the protocol. 
   
   #### Missed growth opportunities and unequal opportunities
     * Projects should be financed based on the quality of the idea and the capability of the team behind the idea, but banks fail to achieve this owing to the fundamental design flaw (Credit-based system).
     * DeFi aims to eradicate this issue by being creditless and instantaneous.

   ### Blockchain basics
    * A blockchain is a digital ledger of data, a chain of blocks, hence the name - blockchain.
    * Each of the blocks have three important pieces of information: 
      1) The data stored in the block
      2) A hash (An encoded string of characters) uniquely generated with respect to the data it contains  
      3) The hash of the previous blockchain.  
    * Since the hash of a block depends on its data, it changes if the data in the block is tampered with, and changing one block will invalidate the blockchain. 
    * DeFi protocols are all built on top of blockchains. This is why, the DeFi protocols are a safer, more transparent way of finance.
    * Defi uses addresses to uniquely identify entities. There are two types of addresses, user wallet address and smart contract address.
    * Both types of address serve the same purpose of uniquely identifying different entities on the blockchain, to send and receive assets, etc.

   ### Use cases of DeFi
   #### Lending and Borrowing
    * DeFi mitigates the problem of unnecessarily high interest rates by employing logic that determines APY and interest premiums based on the supply-demand of a given asset.
    * Lending in DeFi is often more profitable than in TradFi, it is a much safer option as the lender always holds custody of his assets.
    * In the event of a default on loan repayment or a decrease in the value of the security deposit, the protocol will automatically liquidate the collateral and give the proceeds to the lender.
    * The requirement to borrow assests is to have a valid blockchain address and hold an overcollaterized position for the given loan.
  
   
   #### Flash loans
   * DeFi offers loans to the borrower, requiring no collateral to be handed over, to be repaid within one transaction these loans are called Flash loans.
   * In case of a default in repayment, all changes made to the blockchain after the flashloan was taken are reverted.
   * The user only incurs gas fees in this whole process.
   
   #### Asset Exchanges:
    * In central exchanges (Traditional exchanges), often, the central body takes custody of the user's funds and have strict norms regarding the currencies that can be listed on their exchange. 
    * Decentralized exchanges, on the other hand, are trustless and permissionless, meaning only the user holds custody of his assets at all times.
    * There are different types of DEX, notably AMM (Automated market maker), DEX aggregators (liquidity aggregators), and Order Book DEX.
      1)AMMs work on the concept of liquidity pools, where people provide liquidity for given currency pairs (equal values of both currencies) and get incentivized. Users can make use of these pools to exchange currencies. 
      2)DEX Aggregators allow users to get the best exchange rates by simultaneously interacting with multiple liquidity pools. DEX aggregators help solve the problem of lack of liquidity partially by allowing the user to exchange from a larger scale of pools.
      3)Order Book DEX is like a marketplace where some buyers and sellers ask their price and, consequently, determine the market price for the currency under consideration. This process of listing can occur on-chain or off-chain. 

   #### Tokenization:
    * Realworld assets can be stored in the blockchain as tokens, enabling users to sell and buy assets globally.
    * For example, real estate tokenization. A real estate token acts like an NFT, with no other identical copy on the blockchain. The token can accrue interest, and serve as proof of ownership, etc.
    * Another example is debt tokenization. On borrowing or investing, tokens are minted for the user. These tokens accrue interests. On debt repayment or withdrawal of investment, the tokens are burnt. 
    * Tokenized securities (bonds, options, stocks, etc.) can be used to digitize securities, improving their safety and providing 24-hour trading windows, since blockchains are global.
    * With tokenization, fractional ownership of assets can be employed.
